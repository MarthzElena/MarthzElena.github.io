			<p class="subtitle2">CMDR Mobile for Android</p>
			<p>CMDR is a desktop and mobile app for planning and executing missions with DJI drones, soon to come for 3DR drones too. Through CMDR the user can also upload the photos taken by the drone to Skycatch services and get all the processed data, including 3D and 2D maps from the area, annotations and obstacles.</p>

			<p class="subtitle">November 2013 - September 2015: Agave Lab</p>
			<p class="subtitle2">Avisora</p>
			<p>Avisora is an iOS, Android and Web social network that allows people to report day-to-day problems they encounter in any of the four categories Environment, City, Security and Driving. The objective of this platform is to create a link between the problems that citizens face and the proper governments departments to solve these issues. Users can create reports, subscribe to other reports, add photos and comment in order to create a consciousness about the situations that surround our city.</p>
			<p>Currently I’m in charge of the Android development for Avisora that is developed in native Android using Android Studio, plus some libraries like Volley for HTTP requests and Google play services, among others.</p>
			<p class="subtitle2">Agave Lab website</p>
			<p>Agave Lab is a mobile and web apps development agency located in Guadalajara. I developed their webpage using HTML, CSS and Javascript so that clients could see the current and all the projects the agency has worked with. </p>
			<p class="subtitle2">Gaggle: Safe, Online Teaching and Learning Tools for K-12</p>
			<p>Gaggle is an iOS App aimed to students and teachers; its objective is to create the experience of a classroom in a mobile application for online students.</p> 
			<p>I worked with a small team developing the Android version by reverse engeneering the server from the client. Gaggle for Android was developed in native Android using Eclipses Android SDK.</p>
			<p class="subtitle2">WebPT: Physical Therapy Software</p>
			<p>WebPT is a tablet app for phisical therapy clinics, in order to have a better control of the patients and a more efficient intake of data. </p>

		<div class="content">
			<p class="subtitle">November 2015 – Present: Coding Club at Centro Educativo Koala A.C.</p>
			<p>This project is based on Code.org’s program 1 Hour of Code and the objective is to teach children the basics of coding and problem solving, in order to help them improve their daily decisions and performance. I truly believe that doesn’t matter if you get to be a developer or programmer, but if you know the basics of coding you will have more tools to take decisions and solve problems.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="subtitle">March 2015 – Present: Hackers and Founders WOMEN</p>
			<p>Hackers and Founders is a global community that helps entrepreneurs and founders so that more startups succeed. Guadalajara started about 4 years ago having H/F chapters but we noticed that only 5% percent of the attendants were women. So we decided that H/F Women needed to be created in order to attract more women to be entrepreneurs and start their own businesses. We are not a women support club but it is true that we need to find different tools and ways to inspire more women to be part of technology and entrepreneurship.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="subtitle">February 2013 - January 2014: PáginaDos</p>
			<p>Co-Founded PáginaDos which was an online platform to sell and buy academic books. I set the database for the users, the web platform and online catalog.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="subtitle">August 2010 - November 2010: Fundación HACE</p>
			<p>Worked with Fundación HACE, for social service at ITESM. The objective was to develop an app for autistic children using Arduino and a touch lcd screen, to allow them to communicate with others through images.</p>

			<p>This is a methodology created in Freshout and based on the scientific method used to solve problems. This process follows a series of steps that are: discovery of a problem or turning the task you have into a problem that needs to be solved, the definition of the problem you previously specified and creation of a theory to solve it, next is the documentation and further specification of the proposed solution based on prototypes and research and finally the implementation and analysis of results.</p>
