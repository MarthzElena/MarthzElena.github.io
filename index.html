			<p class="subtitle">March 2015 – Present: Hackers and Founders WOMEN</p>
			<p>Hackers and Founders is a global community that helps entrepreneurs and founders so that more startups succeed. Guadalajara started about 4 years ago having H/F chapters but we noticed that only 5% percent of the attendants were women. So we decided that H/F Women needed to be created in order to attract more women to be entrepreneurs and start their own businesses. We are not a women support club but it is true that we need to find different tools and ways to inspire more women to be part of technology and entrepreneurship.</p>
